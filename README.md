Advent of code 2022
=====

This years Advent of code will I try to build in C++20 and run on an ESP32. Since I won't be having a filesystem I'll be creating a cpp-file from input.txt which will contain a `std::vector<std::string>` with the content.

It is my first project built with CMake as well, this could be daunting.
